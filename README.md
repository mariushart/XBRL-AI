# XBRL-AI

The purpose of this project is to apply XBRL in AI and Machine Learning, by usage of Python.

The project will be divided into 3 parts:
1. Generic XBRL to AI.
  1. XBRL-AI.py
1. XBRL in Danish GAAP og Danish IFRS (with extension) to AI
  1.To be added
1. Sample of Machine Learning implementation based on this project
  1.To be added

## Why this project?

Working with machine learning basicly comes down to one thing: y = f(X), y is that we wants to predict, X is the input og f is the machine learning model. Unfortunately X hardly ever fits into to f. If we wants to fit eg. an XBRL-instance into to f, we need to prepare the data. XBRL needs a good representation to fit into AI and Machine learning.

Creating a good and standardised representation of XBRL into AI and Machine learning is the main purpose of this project.
